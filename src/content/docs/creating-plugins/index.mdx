import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import RequiredStar from "@vencord-docs/components/RequiredStar.astro"

## Prerequisites

- A [development Vencord install](../installing/index.mdx)
- VSCode with the extensions recommended by Vencord

Other knowledge requirements include:

- JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge
- Basic regex knowledge
- Basic knowledge of the command line
- Basic knowledge of how to use chrome devtools
- The ability to understand code from just reading it, without requiring documentation
- Basic react knowledge (if you want to do anything with ui)

## Plugin Setup

First, decide whether you want to use the `src/plugins` or `src/userplugins` folder.

### Official Plugins vs UserPlugins

<Tabs syncKey="plugins-type">
    <TabItem label="Plugin">
        Plugins inside `src/plugins` are tracked via git and are included in the official Vencord releases.

        Use this location if you intend to [submit your plugin for inclusion in Vencord](./submission).
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="UserPlugin">
        Plugins inside `src/userplugins` are private. They are not tracked via git.

        Use this location if you don't intend to submit your plugin for inclusion in Vencord.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once you have decided, create a folder with the name of your plugin inside the chosen directory.

The folder's name should be in camelCase. For example `myFirstPlugin` (NOT `MyFirstPlugin` or `my first plugin`)

### Plugin Structure

There are 3 special files you can create here:
- `index.ts` / `index.tsx`<RequiredStar name="file"/>: Your plugin's entry point.
- `README.md`<RequiredStar name="file"/>: Markdown documentation for your plugin. This file
    should contain a description of your plugin and instructions how to use it.
    Screenshots, videos or gifs are highly recommended.
    This will be used to generate a custom webpage for your plugin at https://vencord.dev/plugins/YourPlugin.
- `native.ts`: Your plugin's native entry point. This code will run inside NodeJS instead of the browser.
    If you need to run code on the system, for example to read/write files, you can do so via this file.

### Plugin Boilerplate

Start creating your plugin by adding an `index.ts` file inside your plugin's folder.

Type `vcPlugin` in the file, and you should automatically be suggested the "Define Plugin" template.

:::note
If this doesn't work for you, follow the [editor setup guide](../installing/editor-setup#installing-the-recommended-extensions)
to install the Vencord Companion extension.
:::

Now that you've done this, the file should look like this:

```ts
import { Devs } from "@utils/constants";
import definePlugin from "@utils/types";

export default definePlugin({
    name: "name",
    description: "description",
    authors: [Devs.author],
});
```

Fill out the `name` and `description` fields in the `definePlugin` call.

```ts "MyCoolPlugin" "I am very cute!"
export default definePlugin({
    name: "MyCoolPlugin",
    description: "I am very cute!",
    authors: [Devs.author],
});
```

For the authors property, how you do this will depend on whether you're making a plugin or a userplugin.

<Tabs syncKey="plugins-type">
    <TabItem label="Plugin">
        If this is your first time contributing, you will first have to add yourself to the `Devs` object. 
        It should already be imported, so just jump to its definition and add yourself to the obejct.
        Now, set authors to the new property!
        ```ts ins="Devs.author"
        export default definePlugin({
            name: "MyCoolPlugin",
            description: "I am very cute!",
            authors: [Devs.author],
        });
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="UserPlugin">
        Just set it to a plain object with your info:
        ```ts ins="{ name: \"Your Name\", id: 1234567890n }"
        export default definePlugin({
            name: "MyCoolPlugin",
            description: "I am very cute!",
            authors: [{ name: "Your Name", id: 1234567890n }],
        });
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Save your file and it should automatically format it and insert the following license header on the top.

<Code lang="ts" mark={["Vendicated and contributors"]} code={
`/*
 * Vencord, a Discord client mod
 * Copyright (c) ${new Date().getFullYear()} Vendicated and contributors
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
 */`
}/>

If you want, you can change it from `Vendicated and contributors` to your own name.
But this is not strictly necessary, you own the code either way (and are already included in the "contributors" part).

:::note
If this doesn't work for you, follow the [editor setup guide](../installing/editor-setup#installing-the-recommended-extensions)
to set up linting.

This is all of the boilerplate needed for a Vencord plugin. You can now start making your plugin!
